# Pothole-Detection

This project focuses on improving road maintenance through efficient and accurate pothole detection using imaging techniques. Utilizing the Canny edge detection algorithm, we analyze high-resolution images captured from vehicle-mounted cameras. The preprocessing steps include color space transformation and noise reduction to enhance image quality. The algorithm then identifies potential pothole locations and distinguishes real from false positives using similarity functions. This approach aims to enhance road safety and contribute to smart city infrastructure. Future improvements may integrate additional sensors and machine learning for even more robust detection.
